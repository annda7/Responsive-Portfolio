## Responsive Portfolio
Responsive-Portfolio is a similar project to Basic Portfolio we created for 
assignment #1 during the UW coding Bootcamp, this time we are going to add @media queries
to make it user friendly for different devices, such as smart phone, tablet or other screens.

## Motivation
The motivation behind the assignment is that the majority of users on the internet
browse websites on different devices other than pc or laptop screen.
